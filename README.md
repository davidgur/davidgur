### Hey! üëã I'm David 
#### I'm studying computer science at the University of Waterloo. 

My most recent position was at Applied Mind where I worked on their software-defined radio solution.
Specifically, I developed embedded signal acquisition software for the acquisition and processing of LTE signals at over 50 MHz on their in-house hardware.
I also worked on some drivers for other hardware, like jitter attenuators. 
Most of the work was done in Rust and C.

In the summer of 2019, I worked as a research assistant at York University in the department of mathematics and statistics, where I researched and implemented an [agent based model](https://github.com/davidgur/AgentBasedModel) of the spread of infectious diseases (specifically, measles) in Ontario secondary schools.

In my free time, I like to mess around with my stock portfolio, and experiment with different portfolio optimization algorithms. 
Sid Meier's Civilization VI is also fun.

I'm most comfortable in Python and C++, and have experience writing production code in both. Beyond that, I've worked in many different languages including MATLAB and Rust. You'll be able to find more information on my [resume](https://github.com/davidgur/resume/raw/master/resume.pdf) üìù.
