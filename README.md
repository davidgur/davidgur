### Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm David 
#### I'm studying computer science and applied mathematics at the University of Waterloo. 

I have gained experience in many aspects of signal processing and embedded computation, from implementing software-defined radios on embedded platforms, to designing optimal algorithms for signal emitter localization. Through my work experience, I have demonstrated proficiency in programming languages such as Python, C++, and Rust, as well as mathematical libraries like NumPy and SciPy, which have allowed me to efficiently process and analyze data in these projects.
