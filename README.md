### Hey! 👋 I'm David 
#### I'm studying computer science at the University of Waterloo. 

My most recent position was at Research in Flows, where I worked on the research, architecture, and development of their data acquisition and signal processing pipeline. We used this system to perform turbulent flow analysis for industrial applications.

In the summer of 2019, I worked as a research assistant at York University in the department of mathematics and statistics, where I researched and implemented an [agent based model](https://github.com/davidgur/AgentBasedModel) of the spread of infectious diseases (specifically, measles) in Ontario secondary schools.

I'm most comfortable in Python and C++, and have experience writing production code in both. Beyond that, I've dabbled in many different languages including MATLAB and Go. You'll be able to find more information on my [resume](https://github.com/davidgur/resume/raw/master/resume.pdf) 📝.
